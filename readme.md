# MP3 File Formatter
![]

## Overview

This is a fork of [https://github.com/CMURPH56/python_mp3](CMURPH56's MP3 File Formatter) . I've added a GUI with Tkinter along with a window single file executable.

Python script that iterates over mp3 files in a directory and removes track number from name of file
